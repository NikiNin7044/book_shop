# Book Shop (without books for now).

A Flutter Project with Authorization, Registration, Shop page and individual books pages, also with shopping cart and favorites.

## Auth window.
The Home window. Has TextFields for Login and Password, a button to enter account and a button to go to a registration window.

This is how it looks.
